# NexaConnect — Investor Pitch Deck
## Content & Speaker Notes
### February 2026

---

## Slide 1: Title

**NexaConnect**
*The NDIS Provider Discovery Platform*

Find your support, your way.

Newcastle, NSW | 2026

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

### NDIS participants can't find the right providers.

- **$44.7 billion** in NDIS funding — but 25-43% of plans go **unspent** in the Hunter region
- The government directory (Provider Choice) has terrible UX — no reviews, no comparison tools
- Participants rely on **word-of-mouth** and **outdated Google results**
- Small providers can't afford digital marketing — they're invisible online
- **Result**: Participants don't get the support they need. Providers miss out on clients. Billions in approved funding sit unused.

*Speaker notes: This is a two-sided marketplace problem. Demand exists (funded participants), supply exists (registered providers), but the connection layer is broken. NexaConnect fixes the connection.*

---

## Slide 3: The Opportunity

### A $44.7B market with no clear winner

| | |
|---|---|
| Total NDIS market (2025) | **$44.7 billion** |
| Active participants | **646,000** |
| Registered providers | **21,734** |
| Hunter region participants | **~35,000** |
| Hunter plan utilisation | **57-75%** |
| Unspent funding (Hunter, est.) | **$500M+/year** |

Newcastle was one of the **original NDIS trial sites** (2013). The infrastructure is here. The participants are here. The providers are here. What's missing is the platform.

*Speaker notes: The NDIS is the biggest social reform in Australian history. It's also one of the most fragmented markets — thousands of small providers, hundreds of thousands of participants, and no dominant marketplace. This is the opportunity.*

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

### NexaConnect — Where NDIS participants meet great providers

**For Participants (Free):**
- Search providers by category, location, rating
- Read verified reviews
- Submit support requests — get matched to providers
- Book appointments, message directly

**For Providers (Freemium):**
- Professional profile with photos, services, availability
- Receive qualified leads — pay $25 per unlock
- Analytics dashboard — track views, enquiries, conversions
- Tier upgrades for branding, promoted placement, advanced analytics

**The magic**: Participants browse for free. Providers only pay when a real, interested participant wants to connect. Everyone wins.

---

## Slide 5: How It Works

```
1. PARTICIPANT searches for "OT in Newcastle"
         ↓
2. Browses providers — filters by rating, availability, plan type
         ↓
3. Submits a SUPPORT REQUEST with their needs
         ↓
4. Matched PROVIDERS see the lead (anonymised)
         ↓
5. Provider pays $25 to UNLOCK contact details
         ↓
6. Provider contacts participant → new client relationship
```

**Conversion flow**: View → Compare → Request → Match → Connect

*Speaker notes: The $25 lead fee is dramatically cheaper than Google Ads ($5-15 per click, with 2-5% conversion = $100-750 per client). We deliver pre-qualified leads for $25.*

## Slide 8: Market Landscape

### Competitive positioning

```
                    HIGH FUNCTIONALITY
                          ↑
                          |
              NexaConnect |  Hireup
              (lead model)|  (employment)
                          |
    LOW COST ←────────────┼────────────→ HIGH COST
                          |
         Provider Choice  |  Mable
         (gov directory)  |  (10-15% commission)
                          |
                          ↓
                    LOW FUNCTIONALITY
```

**Our advantage**: Performance-based pricing (pay per lead, not commission), local-first strategy, provider tools that no one else offers at this price point.

| Competitor | Their Model | Our Edge |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Hireup | Employment marketplace | We serve *providers*, not just support workers |
| Mable | 10-15% ongoing commission | Our $25/lead is 5-10x cheaper long term |
| Clickability | Basic directory | We have leads, analytics, real-time messaging |
| Provider Choice | Govt directory, no UX | We have reviews, comparison, search, bookmarks |
