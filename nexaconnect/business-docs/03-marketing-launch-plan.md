## 90-Day Go-To-Market Strategy
### February 2026

## Launch Objective

**In 90 days, establish NexaConnect as Newcastle's go-to NDIS provider discovery platform with 50 registered providers and 200 active participants.**

---

## Target Audiences

### Primary: NDIS Participants & Families
- **Demographics**: 18-65+, Newcastle/Lake Macquarie/Hunter Valley
- **Pain points**: Can't find the right provider, overwhelmed by choice, don't know what's available, underusing their plan
- **Where they are**: Facebook groups, LAC offices, plan management companies, disability expos, Google search
- **Message**: "Find your perfect NDIS provider in minutes, not months"

### Secondary: NDIS Service Providers
- **Demographics**: Small-medium businesses, 1-50 employees, therapy/support/allied health
- **Pain points**: Client acquisition is expensive, rely on word-of-mouth, no digital marketing expertise
- **Where they are**: Industry events, business networks, LinkedIn, Google, email
- **Message**: "Get qualified client leads for $25 each — only pay when you're interested"
